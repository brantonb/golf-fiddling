* rows must be even
* scroll limit is calculable
* ~~drag to transform up/left?~~
* Invalid neighbor indicator should be a single border per pairing
* Wooden signs?
* Scorecard course name?
* Does SuperShot! do anything?

Todos:
* Movement tool could benefit from held arrow keys registering.
* Metadata tool should send you back to previous tool or paint tool
* Movement tool should automatically switch the flag being displayed!
* Movement tool sprite highlighting is kinda bizarre -- why is it 2x2 tiles
* Measurement tool should show sum in status bar
* Movement tool needs to unset the status bar when it's done/deactivated
* Forest border tiles are "subset" of fill tiles--can we exploit this?
Bugs:
* Palette tile crashes on out of range paint
* Should right click in transform send us back to paint + eyedropper?
  * How would that work?  How does paint get that right click event?
* Select tool delete leaves fill instead of placeholder



Thoughts:
* It can be tough to know when to "cut bait"
* I have a temptation to fix problems at the abstraction level I'm working at (claude code), even when fixing the problem is just a few changes to a few lines in a few files.
